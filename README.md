# Key Distinguishing Features of When2Meet (vs. Doodle)
The key distinguishing features of When2Meet-like interfaces (as opposed to Doodle-like interfaces) are that the user enters their availability (in terms of ranges of times/hours) into a calendar/timetable visually, for each of the pre-defined possible dates for the event, whereas in Doodle-like interfaces, the user simply enters whether they are a "yes", "yes if need be", or "no" for each of the pre-defined times for the event. In a When2Meet-like interface, a user can enter their availability by toggling/clicking a single half-hour timeslot between available and unavailable, or by clicking and dragging to toggle a contiguous range of timeslots between available and unavailable.
